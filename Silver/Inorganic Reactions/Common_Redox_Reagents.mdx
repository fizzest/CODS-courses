In this module, we will be covering common redox reagents. Many questions in competitive chemistry expect some level of inorganic trivial knowledge from participants, and this is an ambitious attempt to teach the fundamentals reagents required for all types of questions. Do note that we are merely scratching the surface of the broad field known as inorganic chemistry, and anything beyond the scope of these notes should be learned through either consulting your inorganic chemistry textbook or the internet.

# Common redox reagents

Here are some common redox reagents you will come across in chemistry competitions. Don’t try to brute force remember all of these reagents, but instead, look through the list of reagents often. Let’s start with oxidizing reagents, from simple to more complex.


## **Common oxidizing agents**


### **Ammonium peroxydisulfate ((NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>)**

Peroxydisulfate anion is **one of the strongest** oxidizing reagents on this list. Its _reduced_ product is the **sulfate** (SO<sub>4<sup>2−</sup></sub>) anion. In fact, it is so strong that it can be used to oxidize manganese to **permanganate**, which is another strong oxidizing agent.

Standard potentials are provided below for context. Presence of acid makes the already strong oxidizing agent even stronger.

   <td>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8<sup>2−</sup></sub> + 2 e<sup>−</sup> → 2 SO<sub>4<sup>2−   </sup></sub>
   </td>
   <td>+2.010
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8<sup>2−</sup></sub> + 2 H<sup>+</sup> + 2 e<sup>−</sup> → 2 HSO<sub>4<sup>2−   </sup></sub>
   </td>
   <td>+2.123
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Some common things that peroxydisulfate can oxidize (Do **not** memorize this): 



*   Mn<sup>2+</sup> to MnO<sub>4<sup>−</sup></sub>, Cr<sup>3+</sup> to Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7<sup>2−</sup></sub> (often with a silver catalyst)<sup> </sup>
*   Ag<sup>+</sup> to Ag<sup>2+</sup>
*   <sup> </sup>Ce<sup>3+</sup> to Ce<sup>4+</sup>, VO<sup>2+</sup> to VO<sub>3<sup>−</sup></sub>


### **Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)**

Hydrogen peroxide is also a very common oxidizing agent. It is a strong oxidizing agent in acidic conditions, even stronger than potassium permanganate and chlorine. A mixture of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide is commonly known as piranha solution [[Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0D-MVWAtOc).

Standard potentials are provided below for context. Note that the strength of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing reagent heavily depends on the pH of the solution.

   </td>
   <td>+1.78
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


When hydrogen peroxide is used as an oxidizing agent, the _reduced _product is water.

Some common things that hydrogen peroxide can oxidize (Do **not** memorize this): 



*   Cr<sup>3+</sup> → CrO<sub>4<sup>− </sup></sub>under **basic** conditions
*   Co<sup>2+</sup> → Co<sup>3+ </sup>under **mildly basic** conditions
*   SO<sub>3<sup>2−</sup></sub> → SO<sub>4<sup>2−</sup></sub>
*   Many organic compounds


### **Periodate (IO<sub>4<sup>−</sup></sub>) **

Periodate is also a rather common oxidizing reagent, commonly used in periodate cleavage reactions in organic chemistry. Periodate exists in two forms: **metaperiodate **(IO<sub>4<sup>−</sup></sub>) and **orthoperiodate **(IO<sub>6<sup>5−</sup></sub>). The differences between these two are beyond the scope of the text, but both are very useful oxidizing agents.

Standard potentials are provided below for context. Note that the strength of periodate as an oxidizing reagent also depends on the pH of the solution.

   <td>+1.601
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>H<sub>3</sub>IO<sub>6<sup>2− </sup></sub>+ 2 e<sup>−</sup> → IO<sub>3<sup>− </sup></sub>+ 3 OH<sup>−  </sup>
   </td>
   <td>+0.7
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Some common things that periodate can oxidize (Do **not** memorize this): 



*   Mn<sup>2+</sup> → MnO<sub>4<sup>−</sup></sub>
*   Organic reagents (periodate cleavage is also a redox reaction)


### **Perchlorate (ClO<sub>4<sup>−</sup></sub>)**

Perchloric acid acts as a normal acid in dilute solutions, but becomes a formidable oxidizing agent at high concentrations and temperatures. 

Standard potentials are provided below for context. Note that the strength of perchlorate as an oxidizing reagent depends **heavily **on the pH of the solution. The lower the pH, the stronger it is as an oxidizing agent.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Reaction</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>E°/V</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>2 ClO<sub>4<sup>−</sup></sub> + 16 H<sup>+</sup> + 14 e<sup>−</sup> → Cl<sub>2</sub> (g) + 8 H<sub>2</sub>O
   </td>
   <td>+1.42
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Some common things that perchlorate can oxidize (Do **not** memorize this): 



*   Cr<sup>3+</sup> → Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7<sup>2− </sup></sub>
*   VO<sup>2+</sup> → VO<sub>3<sup>−</sup></sub>
*   I<sup>− </sup>→ IO<sub>3<sup>−</sup></sub>

Perchlorate has some compatibility issues with certain compounds. For example, it is incompatible with organic compounds, as there is a high risk of explosion.


### **Hypochlorite (OCl<sup>−</sup>)**

The most common form of hypochlorite is sodium hypochlorite, which is sold in dilute solutions as bleach. **Hypochlorite is the strongest oxidizing agent**, and perchlorate is the weakest. This is evidently illustrated by the standard potential shown below:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Reaction</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>E°/V</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>2 HOCl + 2 H<sup>+</sup> + 2 e<sup>−</sup> → Cl<sub>2</sub> (g) + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O<sup> </sup>
   </td>
   <td>+1.63
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Similar to perchlorates, the power of hypochlorite as an oxidizing agent decreases with increasing pH. This is true for **all oxoacids of chlorine**.


### **Halogens (F<sub>2</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>)**

Halides are also great oxidizing agents. Fluorine is one of the strongest oxidizing agents, much stronger than peroxydisulfate. In acidic solutions, it becomes even more oxidizing than it already is. 

Chlorine gas is much less oxidizing than fluorine, but it is still a **powerful oxidizing agent**. Liquid bromine is a mildly powerful oxidizing agent, and becomes _very slightly_ more oxidizing in aqueous solution. Solid iodine is a weak oxidizing agent. Standard potentials are provided below for context. Note that the strength of halides (with the exception of fluorine gas) as an oxidizing reagent **DOES NOT** depend on the pH of the solution. 


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Reaction</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>E°/V</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Cl<sub>2</sub> (g) + 2 e<sup>−</sup> → 2 Cl<sup>−  </sup>
   </td>
   <td>+1.35827
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Br<sub>2</sub> (aq) + 2 e<sup>−</sup> → 2 Br<sup>−  </sup>
   </td>
   <td>+1.0873
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>I<sub>2</sub> (s) + 2 e<sup>−</sup> → 2 I<sup>−  </sup>
   </td>
   <td>+0.5355
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



### **Permanganate (MnO<sub>4<sup>−</sup></sub>)**

Permanganate is a very common oxidizing agent. Often, potassium permanganate is used as the source, and when dissolved in water, it is intensely purple. Depending on the pH of the solution, the _reduced _product of permanganate changes:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Acidic solution
   </td>
   <td>~Neutral solution
   </td>
   <td>(strong) Basic solution
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Mn<sup>2+</sup>
   </td>
   <td>MnO<sub>2</sub>
   </td>
   <td>MnO<sub>4<sup>2-</sup></sub>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Permanganate (+7) is reduced to **manganese cation **(+2) in acidic solutions. The color change is extreme; you do **not** need an indicator in redox titrations involving permanganate in acidic solutions. 

Also, permanganate is **not** a primary standard, and you **cannot** use acid halides (such as hydrochloric acid) to prepare a solution. Permanganate is strong enough to oxidize chlorides and bromides and therefore **cannot** be used in titrations which involve those species.

You may see permanganate being used in some organic reactions as well, such as in hydroxylation of alkenes.

Permanganate is considered a **strong oxidizing agent**. Standard potentials are provided below for context. Do note that its cell potential is dependent on pH, as H<sup>+</sup> is present in the reaction.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Reaction</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>E°/V</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>MnO<sub>4<sup>− </sup></sub>+ 8 H<sup>+</sup> + 5 e<sup>−</sup> → Mn<sup>2+</sup> + 4 H<sub>2</sub>O
   </td>
   <td>+1.51
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>MnO<sub>4<sup>−</sup></sub> + 4 H<sup>+</sup> + 3 e<sup>−</sup> → MnO<sub>2</sub> (s) + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O
   </td>
   <td>+1.69
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>MnO<sub>4<sup>−</sup></sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + 3 e<sup>−</sup> → MnO<sub>2</sub> (s) + 4 OH<sup>−</sup>
   </td>
   <td>+0.595
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>MnO<sub>4<sup>−</sup></sub> + e<sup>−</sup> → MnO<sub>4<sup>2−</sup></sub>
   </td>
   <td>+0.558
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Note that the second reaction occurs in a **weakly **acidic solution, and the third reaction occurs in a **weakly** basic solution. 

Some common things that permanganate can oxidize (Do **not** memorize this): 



*   Aldehydes, alcohols, alkenes, aromatic side-chains
*   Fe(II) to Fe(III), Sn(II) to Sn(IV)
*   VO<sup>2+</sup> (IV) → VO<sub>3<sup>− </sup></sub>(V) (in acidic solution)
*   Cr(OH)<sub>3</sub> (III) → CrO<sub>4<sup>2−</sup></sub> (VI) (in basic solution)


#### **Why is permanganate a strong oxidizing agent?**

Permanganate, and many other transition metals with **high oxidation states** tend to be great oxidizing reagents. Because elements in higher oxidation states tend to have a more “exposed” nucleus than lower oxidation states, they like to rip electrons off of compounds and end up with a more stable, lower oxidation state.


### **Dichromate (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7<sup>2−</sup></sub>)**

Dichromate is another very common oxidizing agent. Depending on the pH of the solution, it exists as **dichromate (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7<sup>2−</sup></sub>, orange) in acid, **and as **chromate (CrO<sub>4<sup>2−</sup></sub>, yellow) in base**. The _reduced_ products of dichromate/chromate also depends on pH:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Acidic solution
   </td>
   <td>Basic solution
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Cr<sup>3+</sup>
   </td>
   <td>Cr(OH)<sub>3</sub>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Unlike** permanganate, dichromate **does** **require **an indicator for redox titrations (diphenylamine sulphonate is a common choice). It **can** be used as a primary standard, and **can **be used in presence in _low concentrations_ of chloride ions. So yes, dichromate vs. permanganate isn’t always a “preference” thing.

You may have heard of “chromic acid” being used in some organic reactions, in particular, oxidation of alcohols. This is made by dissolving potassium dichromate in a very acidic solution (commonly with sulfuric acid).

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Di</span>chromate** is also considered as a **strong oxidizing agent**. Standard potentials are provided below for context. Do note that its cell potential is dependent on pH, as H<sup>+</sup> is present in the reaction.

   <td><strong>E°/V</strong>

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7<sup>2−</sup></sub> + 14 H<sup>+</sup> + 6 e<sup>−</sup> → 2 Cr<sup>3+</sup> + 7 H<sub>2</sub>O<sup>  </sup>
   </td>
   <td>+1.33
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>CrO<sub>4<sup>2−</sup></sub> + 4 H<sub>2</sub>O + 3 e<sup>−</sup> → Cr(OH)<sub>3</sub> + 5 OH<sup>−   </sup>
   </td>
   <td>−0.13 
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Some common things that dichromate can oxidize (Do **not** memorize this): 



*   Aldehydes, alcohols (ethanol & dichromate is very common)
*   Fe(II), Zn(II)


### **Nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>)**

Nitric acid is another common oxidizing agent with a variety of uses. Its _reduced_ products can be difficult to predict, especially when it is dilute acid, as it tends to be a mixture of products (NO, N<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, NH<sub>4<sup>+</sup></sub>). In general,


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>dilute HNO<sub>3</sub>
   </td>
   <td>Conc. HNO<sub>3</sub>
   </td>
   <td>Active metals (alkali)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>NO</strong> +  mixture
   </td>
   <td><strong>NO<sub>2</sub></strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>N<sub>2</sub>O</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


This table should be taken with a grain of salt. Do note that for _most_ metals, dilute HNO<sub>3</sub> will act as a normal acid rather than an oxidizing agent. 

Nitric acid is considered a **strong oxidizing agent**. Cell potentials are omitted as the mechanism of nitric acid as an oxidizing reagent is extremely complex and beyond the scope of this text. Its strength is also dependent on the pH and temperature of the solution.

Some common things that nitric acid can oxidize (Do **not** memorize this): 



*   Concentrated nitric acid can oxidize many non-metals:
    *   I<sub>2</sub> → HIO<sub>3</sub> (it cannot oxidize chloride anions)
    *   P<sub>4</sub> → H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
    *   S<sub>8</sub> → H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
    *   C (gr) → CO<sub>2</sub>
*   Concentrated nitric acid can oxidize most metals, with the exception of gold and platinum-group metals (commonly used to dissolve alloys)
*   Many organic compounds (nitration)


### **Sodium bismuthate (NaBiO<sub>3</sub>)**

Sodium bismuthate is also a **strong oxidizing agent**, but has one unique feature- it is **insoluble** in cold water. This makes sodium bismuthate very easy to filter out after oxidation. The strength of bismuthate as an oxidizing agent is dependent on the pH of the solution. The more acidic the solution, the stronger its oxidizing power is.

Some common things that bismuthate can oxidize (Do **not** memorize this): 



*   Mn<sup>2+</sup> → MnO<sub>4<sup>−</sup></sub>
*   Ce<sup>3+</sup> → Ce<sup>4+</sup>

**Allotropes of Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>)**

The term “oxidize” comes from oxygen, so we would assume that oxygen would also be a decent oxidizing agent. And you would certainly be correct. However, this commonly comes more as a consequence rather than intent. Ozone, which is an allotrope of oxygen gas, is an even stronger oxidizing agent than oxygen itself, and is commonly used in alkene cleavage reactions.

 Standard potentials are provided below for context. Do note that its strength as an oxidizing agent is dependent on pH.

Some common things that ozone can oxidize (Do **not** memorize this): 



*   Mn<sup>2+</sup> → MnO<sub>2</sub>
*   Br<sup>−</sup> → BrO<sub>3<sup>−</sup></sub>
*   Alkenes




## **Common reducing agents**


### **Zinc**

Taking a look at the electrochemical series should make it clear that there are other metals that can be used as reducing agents. However, zinc tends to be the most common and therefore will be covered in these sets of notes. 

Zinc is considered a mildly strong reducing agent. Standard potentials are provided below for context. One thing to note about zinc is that, similar to Aluminum (another reactive metal), it forms a protective passivating layer of **zinc carbonate **(Zn<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>), making it less effective. Therefore, it is more common to see zinc being used in the form of **amalgamated zinc **“Zn(Hg)” as the amalgam does not have the passivating layer, making it a much more effective reducing agent than pure zinc metal. Amalgamated zinc is a key component of the **Jones reductor**, used to reduce aqueous metal ions to low oxidation states.

   <td>Zn<sup>2+</sup> + 2 e<sup>−</sup> → Zn(Hg)

Some common things that zinc can reduce (Do **not** memorize this): 



*   Clemmensen Reduction
*   Jones reductor; can prepare Ti(III), V(II), Cr(II), Mo(III), U(III)
*   Sn(IV) → Sn(II)


### **Sulfite (SO<sub>3<sup>2−</sup></sub>)**

Sulfur reducing agents are **very** common, and we’ll take a look at sulfur(IV) reducing agents first. Regardless of whether it is in the form of sulfite (SO<sub>3<sup>2−</sup></sub>) or sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), both are **mildly strong reducing agents** (more reducing in basic solutions than acidic). Sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), when dissolved in water, exists mainly as the bisulfite anion and therefore a weaker reducing agent than sulfite. The _oxidized_ product of sulfite is sulfate (or bisulfate if acidic).

   </td>
   <td>−0.93
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Example Use Case**: SO<sub>2</sub> + Fe<sup>3+</sup> → Fe<sup>2+</sup> + SO<sub>4<sup>2−</sup></sub>


### **Thiosulfate (S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3<sup>2−</sup></sub>)**

Thiosulfate is a very common sulfur reducing agent. It is most commonly used in** iodometric titrations**, reducing **triiodide **to iodide. The oxidized product of thiosulfate in this reaction is **tetrathionate**, or S<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6<sup>2−</sup></sub>. While it is fairly uncommon to see thiosulfate being used in other places, the oxidized product **tends to be different** depending on what it is reducing.

For example, reaction with thiosulfate and aqueous bromine or chlorine results in **sulfate **(sulfite is a good reducing agent!) instead of tetrathionate. Therefore, much caution should be put into predicting the products of thiosulfate. 

Thiosulfate is also **unstable in acidic solutions**. It will undergo **disproportionation**, where thiosulfate acts as a reducing agent for another thiosulfate anion, forming **elemental sulfur** and **sulfur dioxide gas**. Therefore, it must be used in neutral or basic solutions. 

Thiosulfate is considered a very mild reducing agent. Standard potentials are provided below for context.

#### **Triiodide and Thiosulfate**

_Note: This section of the notes will be moved to the “Titrations” module on the actual website._

This is something you should **most definitely memorize**, as it is a very common reaction in all levels of competitive chemistry. We will first take a look at iodometry, as it is much simpler.

In the presence of **both Iodine and iodide** in aqueous solution, the linear anion **triiodide** (I<sub>3<sup>−</sup></sub>) is formed. 

I<sub>2</sub> + I<sup>−</sup> ⇌ I<sub>3<sup>−  </sup></sub>

This reaction is **very favorable** and is sold commercially as an aqueous solution of potassium iodide mixed with solid iodine; this is also known as **Lugol’s iodine**. 

Iodometry is the process of determining how much iodine is present in a given solution. Alternatively, this procedure can also be used to determine the concentration of a given oxidizing agent, by having an excess** but known** amount of iodide and oxidizing the iodide into solid iodine, which is expected to mostly convert into triiodide (This procedure is known as “back titration” and you can learn more about it in our titration notes.)

The triiodide is reduced **back** into iodine by sodium thiosulfate as the reducing agent. This reaction is **fast** and is **very important**.

2 S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3<sup>2−</sup></sub> (aq) + I<sub>3<sup>−</sup></sub> (aq) → S<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6<sup>2−</sup></sub> (aq) + 3 I<sup>−</sup> (aq)

A triiodide solution is dark brown, and therefore a **starch indicator** is used to make the end point of the titration more clear. It is a **deep blue** color when starch complexes with triiodide (iodine-starch clathrate) and a very light yellow color when there is no presence of triiodide. 

_Note: We are working on an example problem (and a list of problems that utilize iodometry as a concept) for this section on the live website coming this summer._


### **Oxalic acid (H<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)**

Oxalic acid is also used as a common reducing agent. There are many things to like about this compound. It’s _oxidized _product is **carbon dioxide**, and is considered a **primary standard**. 


### **Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)**

Hydrogen peroxide can **also** be used as a **reducing agent**. Recall that hydrogen peroxide becomes a weaker oxidizing agent with decreasing pH; in basic solutions, **hydrogen peroxide may act as a reducing agent**, releasing **oxygen gas**. 

Some common things that hydrogen peroxide can reduce (Do **not** memorize this): 



*   OCl<sup>−</sup> → Cl<sup>−</sup>
*   MnO<sub>4<sup>2−</sup></sub> → MnO<sub>2</sub>
